# Mind-Fusion
This 4-day visual journal captures my project-based learning journey—from identifying the problem and exploring solutions to selecting AI tools, gathering feedback, and finalizing the project concept. Each day’s image reflects key learnings, challenges, and progress made while building the MindFusion – Memory + Logic Hybrid Game.
